# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Summary
Develop two circuit(A and B) where the one of the inputs of si the output of a. Implement theses circuit as separate blocks within Vivado, and use the top.v file to combine them into a single circuit.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
Top file is like the whole unit include tow blocks which is circut a and circuit b. Thm main role top file do is layout or conncet tow blocks together

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
release the switch and led light can work with fpga borard.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?

Yes it is correct. I choose minterm for circuit a , maxterm for circuit b.
