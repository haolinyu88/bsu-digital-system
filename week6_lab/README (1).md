## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
if more than two bits, the carryout from the MSB-1 should propagate to next MSB, and then generate new bit sum.

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
XOR is mean the sum, if all 1 it should generate 0, and carry out 1.

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?

11 + 11(3 + 3) is largest number can handle, it will generate one bit on led[5] and one bit from final sum which is led[4]
